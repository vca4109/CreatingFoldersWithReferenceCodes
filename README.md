# CreatingFoldersWithReferenceCodes
Python project in creating folders with reference codes.

📁 Auto-Folder Creator Script (Python)
This simple Python script automates the creation of multiple folders following a specific naming pattern. It’s especially useful for preparing directory structures for projects, document control, or file organization.

🔧 How It Works
Location: Folders are created inside a specified base directory (you can customize this path).

Naming Pattern: Each folder is named using a prefix (5567-ABC-XYZ-T-) followed by a sequential number (starting from 2002) and a suffix ( - DTF-).

Volume: You can define how many folders to generate (in this case, 100).
