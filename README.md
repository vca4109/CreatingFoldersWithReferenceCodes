This simple Python script automates the creation of multiple folders following a specific naming pattern. Itâ€™s especially useful for preparing directory structures for projects, document control, or file organization.

ðŸ”§ How It Works
Location: Folders are created inside a specified base directory (you can customize this path).

Naming Pattern: Each folder is named using a prefix (5567-ABC-XYZ-T-) followed by a sequential number (starting from 2002) and a suffix ( - DTF-).

Volume: You can define how many folders to generate (in this case, 100).

ðŸ§  Example Output
If the base folder is set to your desktop, the script will create folders like:

C:\Users\ABC\Desktop\Python Program\5567-ABC-XYZ-T-2002 - DTF-
C:\Users\ABC\Desktop\Python Program\5567-ABC-XYZ-T-2003 - DTF-
...
